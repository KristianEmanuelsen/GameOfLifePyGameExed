Conway's Game of Life in Python Pygame including a theme song composed by me (Kristian Emanuelsen) in Cubase 4. The Game of Life program has been converted to exe with PyInstaller to make it accessible to individuals less familiar with using the PC terminal. The version was created in Windows 11 and will probably only work on Windows. If you don't have Windows, you can run the 'terminal version' found elsewhere in my GitHub.
